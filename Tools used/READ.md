Tool Selection Justification
üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on Advanced Features & Optimization in modern data engineering workflows. It covers three major components:

Partitioning/Materialized View SQL

Data Quality Report

dbt Project (Transformations & Modeling)

The following tools were selected to ensure scalability, performance, and reliability.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
1. Google BigQuery

Purpose: Cloud-based data warehouse for querying large datasets.

Why Chosen:

Fully managed and serverless (no infrastructure overhead).

Supports partitioned tables and materialized views for query optimization.

Cost-effective with pay-per-query pricing.

Native integration with Google Cloud ecosystem and dbt.

2. Great Expectations

Purpose: Open-source data validation framework.

Why Chosen:

Enables creation of data quality reports in HTML/PDF.

Provides out-of-the-box tests for missing values, schema consistency, duplicates, and ranges.

Integrates easily with Python and cloud data warehouses.

Ensures trust in data pipelines before analytics and reporting.

3. dbt (Data Build Tool)

Purpose: Data transformation and modeling.

Why Chosen:

Uses SQL-based transformations with modular, version-controlled models.

Supports macros, tests, and documentation for reproducible pipelines.

Integrates seamlessly with BigQuery for optimized query execution.

Allows incremental models and source freshness checks for efficiency.

Supporting Tools in dbt Workflow:

dbt CLI ‚Äì Run transformations, tests, and documentation locally or in CI/CD.

dbt Cloud (optional) ‚Äì Managed service for scheduling and collaboration.

GitHub ‚Äì Version control for dbt project, including models, seeds, snapshots, and macros.

4. GitHub

Purpose: Version control, collaboration, and submission.

Why Chosen:

Ensures code reproducibility with version history.

Supports README documentation for tool justification.

Enables team collaboration through branches and pull requests.

‚úÖ Summary
